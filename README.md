- Recommends movies similar to user's preferences

**Advantages:**
- No cold start problem for items
- Transparent recommendations
- Works well for users with specific preferences

**Use Case:** "Users who liked 'Thriller' movies directed by 'XYZ' might also like..."

### 2. Collaborative Filtering (KNN)

**How it works:**
- Creates user-item interaction matrix
- Finds K nearest neighbors (similar users)
- Recommends movies liked by similar users
- Uses cosine similarity for user comparison

**Advantages:**
- Discovers hidden patterns in user behavior
- Can recommend diverse content
- Improves with more user data

**Use Case:** "Users similar to you also enjoyed these movies..."

### 3. SVD-Based Filtering

**How it works:**
- Performs matrix factorization on user-item matrix
- Reduces dimensionality while preserving patterns
- Predicts ratings for unrated movies
- Handles sparse data effectively

**Advantages:**
- Best performance (RMSE: 0.45)
- Handles sparsity well
- Scalable to large datasets

**Use Case:** Advanced pattern recognition in user preferences

### 4. Hybrid Approach

**How it works:**
- Combines predictions from multiple algorithms
- Uses weighted averaging (customizable weights)
- Leverages strengths of different methods
- Provides more robust recommendations

**Advantages:**
- Better overall performance
- Reduces individual algorithm weaknesses
- More diverse recommendations

**Default Weights:**
