## üéØ Overview

This project implements a sophisticated movie recommendation system using multiple machine learning approaches. The system can suggest movies based on user preferences, viewing history, and movie content features. It includes both Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and a production-ready Streamlit web application.

### Key Highlights

- **Multiple Recommendation Algorithms**: Content-based, Collaborative Filtering (KNN), SVD-based, and Hybrid approaches
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed exploratory data analysis and model evaluation
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Instant movie suggestions based on user input
- **Cold Start Handling**: Recommendations for new users without rating history
- **Performance Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning and model comparison

## ‚ú® Features

   - `Movie_Recommendation_System__Model_Improvement.ipynb`: Advanced techniques and optimization

## üß† Recommendation Algorithms

### 1. Content-Based Filtering

**How it works:**
- Analyzes movie features (genre, director, cast)
- Creates TF-IDF vectors for each movie
- Calculates cosine similarity between movies
- Recommends movies similar to user's preferences

**Advantages:**
- No cold start problem for items
- Transparent recommendations
- Works well for users with specific preferences

**Use Case:** "Users who liked 'Thriller' movies directed by 'XYZ' might also like..."

### 2. Collaborative Filtering (KNN)

**How it works:**
- Creates user-item interaction matrix
- Finds K nearest neighbors (similar users)
- Recommends movies liked by similar users
- Uses cosine similarity for user comparison

**Advantages:**
- Discovers hidden patterns in user behavior
- Can recommend diverse content
- Improves with more user data

**Use Case:** "Users similar to you also enjoyed these movies..."

### 3. SVD-Based Filtering

**How it works:**
- Performs matrix factorization on user-item matrix
- Reduces dimensionality while preserving patterns
- Predicts ratings for unrated movies
- Handles sparse data effectively

**Advantages:**
- Best performance (RMSE: 0.45)
- Handles sparsity well
- Scalable to large datasets

**Use Case:** Advanced pattern recognition in user preferences

### 4. Hybrid Approach

**How it works:**
- Combines predictions from multiple algorithms
- Uses weighted averaging (customizable weights)
- Leverages strengths of different methods
- Provides more robust recommendations

**Advantages:**
- Better overall performance
- Reduces individual algorithm weaknesses
- More diverse recommendations

**Default Weights:**
- Content-Based: 30%
- Collaborative (KNN): 40%
- SVD: 30%
